          <p>
            When content is created with accessibility in mind, it's important that it goes through rigorous testing to ensure it works well with the tools that people with disabilities use. Testing is part of the "rigorous" principle that is discussed in the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. Each web application or website needs several ways to interact with it and if one of those ways does not work the way it’s supposed to, several users may not be able to access information that they need.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several ways to test accessibility, the most foolproof way being true scenario testing. For example, to test if a UI is accessible, the coders can use different screen readers and keyboard navigation applications to make sure it is working as expected. Another faster and easier method is to use automatic accessibility testers.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The W3C has a list of over 150 testing tools on their website (<a href=”https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/” target=”_blank”>W3C tools</a>), with some testing for contrast issues and others testing for the use of ARIA labels. Some tests, like the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (<a href=”https://wave.webaim.org/” target=”_blank”>WebAIM</a>), do general accessibility testing that covers all sorts of issues like contrast issues, alt-text issues, labeling issues, and more. WAVE is free and automated, so the results come back very quickly. It is my go-to accessibility testing tool, but there are plenty of others to use as well.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another testing tool I’d recommend is axe DevTools by Deque Systems (<a href=”https://www.deque.com/axe/” target=”_blank”>axe</a>). It is a free chrome or firefox extension that evaluates any site that you visit. There are paid options for this extension, but the free version provides plenty of features to still make it an attractive option. Deque also provides other testing tools for iOS and Android API’s.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than those two tools, I have not used many others. The WAVE test provides feedback in every aspect that I need and I rarely need any other tools. I also have a disability simulator from silktide (<a href=”https://silktide.com/resources/toolbar/” target=”_blank”>silktide</a>) that helps me test my sites using keyboard functions and their screen reader. It also simulates color blindness, cataracts, and tunnel vision, which is sometimes overlooked in the development of digital content.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, testing all digital content for accessibility features is very important to do before publishing or posting. Once one feature does not work properly, it’s possible the users affected will not return to the site or, even worse, file an accessibility lawsuit. Regardless of the fact that lawsuits aren't a fun ordeal, it should be just as scary to learn that some users could completely avoid a site after one bad visit. With rigorous accessibility testing we can ensure that all users can have good experiences with applications and hopefully come back.

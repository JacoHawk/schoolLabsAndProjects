      <h2>What web accessibility is and why it's important</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="body">
      <p>
        Accessibility is very important both in real life and online. In the US, more than 26 percent of adults live with some kind of disability (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html#:~:text=61%20million%20adults%20in%20the,is%20highest%20in%20the%20South." target="_blank">CDC</a>). With so many people living with disabilities, it is important that we have laws in place to make sure those with disabilities can still access the things they need. For example, every business must have wheelchair accessible parking and also be wheelchair accessible in general. In that same sense, the web also needs to be accessible as it has become a necessity for most people.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The web is especially important for people with disabilities as it can be used as a great tool. Although it can be a very helpful tool, if web pages and documents are not created with accessibility in mind, it can be extremely difficult for some people to complete important tasks online. Color blindness, blindness, cataracts, cognitive issues, autism, and motor dysfunction are all examples of disabilities that could directly impact how someone uses the internet. All of these need to be accounted for so that everyone can see the web as a tool rather than a problem.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        As I stated before, there are laws in place to prevent businesses from being physically inaccessible. Since the internet has become such a vital part of our lives, there are also accessibility laws for digital content.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href=”https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/” target=”_blank”>Section 508 policy</a> was created as part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Under section 508, “agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information comparable to the access available to others.” (<a href=”https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/” target=”_blank”>section508.gov</a>) This amendment made sure that all citizens would have access to the same information, regardless of their physical or mental abilities. The section 508 policy went on to be refreshed in 2017 which led to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) becoming a worldwide standard for web content and Information and Communication Technology (ICT).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even today, the content of the <a href=”https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/” target=”_blank”>WCAG 2.0</a> guidelines continues to evolve as technology advances. WCAG 2.0 was published in 2008, WCAG 2.1 was published in 2018, and WCAG 2.2 is set to be published in the near future. Both WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 have similar guidelines consisting of four main principles:<br><br>
        Perceivable - the content is readable by every sense and the layout aids understanding<br>
        Operable - the user interface and navigation must be operable by every user<br>
        Understandable - users must be able to understand the information shown and must be able to operate the user interface<br>
        Robust - the content must be compatible with current and future assistive technologies<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital accessibility is very important even without these laws and guidelines. Although lawsuits are not a desirable thing, it’s also not desirable to ignore more than 25% of your user base. With that being said, according to the WallStreet Journal, “the number of U.S. lawsuits alleging that websites, apps and digital videos were inaccessible to people with disabilities rose 64% in the first half of 2021 from a year earlier…” (<a href=”https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuits-over-digital-accessibility-for-people-with-disabilities-are-rising-11626369056” target=”_blank”>WSJ</a>). This should be very concerning to businesses and content creators alike, as accessibility should be important even without these lawsuits. The sad reality is that we will all eventually lose important abilities throughout our natural lives. Whether our joints stiffen, our brain’s cognitive function degrades, our eyes blur, or our ears muffle, most of these disabilities would affect how we interact with digital content. When we create accessible digital content today, we are creating it not only for others but for our future selves as well.

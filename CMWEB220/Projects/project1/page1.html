          <h1>Navigation Links</h1>
          <p>
            Over on the left, I have a set of navigation links to the other pages in this project. These links are nested as items in an unordered
            list with the "list-style" set to "none". It's a simple, vertical navbar that is very easy to make. For the styling, I added a color
            transition when hovering over the links. The background of the buttons fades from a light blue to a dark blue, and then back to the light
            blue. This is done using the CSS "transition" element. I also set the "position" to "fixed" for the navbar so that it stays in the same
            place even when scrolling.

          <h1>Page Layout</h1>
          <p>
            As for the page layout, I have 4 different sections laid out using Flexbox. The section on the left is used for the navbar, and the rest
            of the sections are just stacked on top of eachother. I like flexbox because it makes it easy to create multiple sections on a page with
            little effort.

        <div id="p3">
          <h1>Background Color</h1>
          <p>
            For the background color, I'm using an infinite looping keyframes animation that goes from dark green to light green and then back again. To do this, I made a keyframes animation called backgroundLoop. Inside the keyframes animation, I had 8 different percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. At each percentage, I'd change the background color to a different shade of green. I then styled the body using this keyframes animation by simply saying "animation-name: backgroundLoop" and then added an animation duration.

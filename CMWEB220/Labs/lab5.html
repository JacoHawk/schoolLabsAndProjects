        This image uses relative positioning. It allows us to position elements
        at certain distances away from its original place on the page. We can do
        this by using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. The image
        above is translated to the right 100% to place it roughly in the middle
        of the page. I did this by setting its position to relative and then
        adding "left: 100%" to the element.

      <h2 class="sub">Absolute Positioning:</h2>
      <div>
        <img
          id="abs-img"
          src="Assets/Images/think-again.jpeg"

        />
      </div>
      <h3 id="abs-p">
        The image here is using absolute positioning. This allows us to move an
        element wherever we'd like. The best part of this property is the way it
        does not interfere with the flow of other elements. When an element is
        absolute, it pops out of the regular layout and positions itself to its
        positioned ancestor (or the body, if there is no ancestor). Absolute
        positioning is great for popups that don't interfere with the layout of
        the page.

      <h2 class="sub">Fixed Positioning:</h2>
      <div>
        <img
          id="fix-img"
          src="Assets/Images/think-again.jpeg"
          alt="Book titled: Think Again, by Adam Grant"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>
        The image that has fixed positioning is actually floating to the left of
        this page. It stays in the same spot even when the page is scrolled.
        Fixed positioning is much like absolute positioning, except that the
        fixed positioning allows an element to stay in the same place.

    <section id="z">
      <h2 class="sub">Z-Index Example:</h2>
      <p id="first">First</p>
      <p id="second">Second</p>
      <p id="third">Third</p>
      <p id="fourth">Fourth</p>
      <p id="fifth">Fifth</p>
      <h3 id="z-p">
        This is an example of how to use the z-index property. Each element can
        be assigned a z-value which prioritizes the stacking order. An element
        with a z-index of 3 will be placed over any element with a z-index below
        3 (e.g. 2, 1, 0, -1...). For this example, the blue first box has a
        z-index of 4, placing it on top of the other elements. The purple second
        box is given a z-index of 3, and so on until the green fifth box has a
        z-index of 0.

        <p>
          &emsp; Foundation is a bit more complex than Bootstrap, which is both good and bad. More complexity means more customization and more use
          cases. It also means steeper learning curve and higher difficulty overall. Foundation has a DIY approach that can really come in handy to
          pros and experts alike. While it is more complex, it is overall a great framework with tons of features and great functionality.

        <h2>Bootstrap</h2>

          &emsp; Bootstrap, on the other hand, is a bit easier to get a grasp on. Although it doesn't feature as many customization options as
          Foundation, it's meant to be easy and qucik to deploy. Bootstrap is great for beginners like me who just want things done and looking nice.
          Although customization is not as great as other frameworks, there are still themes and other options that can be changed with a little
          tweaking.

          &emsp; Personally, as an intermediate CSS user, I'd prefer Bootstrap over Foundation. Although Bootstrap is not as feature intensive as
          Foundation, it has more than enough features for my use cases. If I had a certain project that was very complex, like making an email UI, I'd definitely want to use Foundation as that's where its features could be really useful. For casual blogs or informative sites, Bootstrap would be a great choice.

<p>Bootstrap Example</p> 
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank"><button class="btn">Bootstrap</button></a>
    <p style="color:#e9e9e9;">Bootstrap is easily the most popular CSS framework out there. It's a pre-built dynamic template with countless ready-to-use components. Almost anything, from alerts to modals to navigation bars, is supported by default. This can make it easier for any developer, even without prior frontend experience, to develop well-structured pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
    <a href="https://get.foundation/" target="_blank"><button class="btn">Foundation</button></a>
    <p style="color:#e9e9e9;">Unlike Bootstrap, Foundation doesn't use a distinct style for its components. Its wide range of modular and flexible components feature minimal styling and can easily be customized.</p><p style="color:#e9e9e9;">Aesthetic email templates are notoriously hard to build. To support older email clients, developers are forced to write 1990s-era HTML code. This makes it hard to deliver modern features such as responsive design. Foundation for Emails can help you create responsive email templates for any client, including old versions of Microsoft Outlook.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
    <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank"><button class="btn">Bulma</button></a>
    <p style="color:#e9e9e9;">Bulma is a great alternative to Bootstrap, as it features modern code and a unique aesthetic. It's easy to use and import into your projects and comes with various pre-made components. It's highly praised for its simple syntax and minimalistic but aesthetic design. It truly is a framework that can make a dull web page look bright and appealing.</p>
</div>
</div class="col-sm-4">
    <a href="https://getuikit.com/" target="_blank"><button class="btn">UIkit</button></a>
    <p style="color:#e9e9e9;">UIKit is a modular frontend framework that allows you to import only the features you need. It has over 16k stars on GitHub, and it's chosen by developers for its easy API and clean-cut design. Additionally, UIKit has a pro version that offers themed pages for WordPress and Joomla, coupled with an easy-to-use page builder.</p>

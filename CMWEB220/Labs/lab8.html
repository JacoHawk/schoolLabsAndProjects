            The app interface is user-friendly and has some great and easy learning tools. Anybody with a little bit of knowledge of editing can get
            some good results. Tools like spot blurring, darkening and brightening are great. You can also add text to your image while editing. It is
            an all in one app for newbies.

            It lacks some features, like automatic transparent background, and things similar to this, in which they require some processing power
            that just isn't possible to do on a website. I feel like it could have many, many more options and better final quality. Professionals
            just have no choice but to opt for a more hefty software.

            Pixlr is free of cost. For beginners, this is the perfect basic app to do simple editing. As for larger projects or files, users will have
            to switch over to a superior (but more expensive) application like those that Adobe offer.

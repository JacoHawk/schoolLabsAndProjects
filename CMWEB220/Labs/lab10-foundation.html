        <h3>Bootstrap <small>Framework</small></h3>
        <p>Bootstrap is easily the most popular CSS framework out there. It's a pre-built dynamic template with countless ready-to-use components. Almost anything, from alerts to modals to navigation bars, is supported by default. This can make it easier for any developer, even without prior frontend experience, to develop well-structured pages.</p>

        <h3>Foundation <small>Framework</small></h3>
        <p>Unlike Bootstrap, Foundation doesn't use a distinct style for its components. Its wide range of modular and flexible components feature minimal styling and can easily be customized.</p><p>Aesthetic email templates are notoriously hard to build. To support older email clients, developers are forced to write 1990s-era HTML code. This makes it hard to deliver modern features such as responsive design. Foundation for Emails can help you create responsive email templates for any client, including old versions of Microsoft Outlook.</p>

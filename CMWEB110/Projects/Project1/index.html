    Introduction

<p id="b1">
    My name is Jacob Hawkins and I'm 20 years old. Currently, I work at Hyvee and have a few hobbies
    to keep myself busy while I'm not at work. I live in Peoria with my parents and one of my sisters, Annette. We have 2 dogs,
    Bailey and Toby, and one cat, Winston. <br><br>
    I found interest in web design mainly because of my love for computers. I never thought to try my hand
    at coding until a friend recently suggested that I should check it out. Ever since then, I joined this
    intro to web design class and I've been loving it so far!

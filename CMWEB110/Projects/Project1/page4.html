        My Hobbies

    <p class="sub">
        On this page, I'd like to talk about my hobbies!
    </p>

    <p class="hobby">
        One of my favorite ways to pass the time is by playing my Nintendo Switch.
    </p>

    <p class="p1"> 
        Currently, I am playing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/19/20870437/zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank"> The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>.
        <br>
        I really love the game so far as it is simple but very visually appealing and fun to play!
    </p>

    <p class="hobby">
        One of my favorite games of all time also happens to be on the Nintendo Switch.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">
        Mario Odyssey is just an excellent game all around.
        Although it's challenging to 100% complete, I like the mechanics Nintendo used for Mario's controls compared to their past 3D Mario games.
        <br><br>
        I also enjoy watching <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/smo" target="_blank">speed runs</a> of Mario Odyssey.
        I've never personally tried my hand at speed running, but maybe one day I will!
    </p>

    <p class="hobby">
        I also have a PC that I spend a lot of time on.
        For the most part I play games on it, but I also like to fine-tune and upgrade my hardware whenever I can.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
        I just got my desktop at the end of April and I've been loving it.
        <br><br>
        Even though I wanted to build my own PC, I had to buy a pre-built PC because of the insane graphics card shortage that's been happening since about December 2020.
        <br><br>
        For those who care, here are some of the specs:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            My graphics card is a Gigabyte RTX 3060 with 12GB of VRAM
        </li>
        <li>
            The processor is an Intel i7 11700F
        </li>
        <li>
            I have 16GB of ram, but I'm looking to upgrade that to 32gb here soon
        </li>
        <li>
            I have a 500GB SSD which I'd like to upgrade to 2TB, as well as a 1TB hard drive
        </li>
        <li>
            For my peripherals I use the Logitech lightspeed wireless keyboard (G915) and mouse (G305) and a curved 27" Dell monitor (S2721HGF)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p1">
        I mostly play games like Valorant and Rainbow Six Siege, but I've been playing <i>a lot</i> of Rocket League lately.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr2">

    <p class="hobby">
        Other than playing video games, I also have a girlfriend, Olivia, who currently lives in Columbia, Missouri, for school.
    </p>

    <p class="p1">
        I try to visit her as often as possible, but sometimes we are both too busy and have to go a while without seeing each other.
        <br><br>
        Although it's tough living so far away, we're hoping to live closer together once she graduates next school year and begins grad school.
    </p>

    <hr class="hr2">

    <p class="hobby">
        For the most part, I spend my days either working, playing video games, working on school work, or visiting my girlfriend when I can.
        <br><br>
        I also enjoy skateboarding, frisbee golfing, hiking, and occasionally kayaking.
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <hr class="hr2">

    <p id="end">
        That's all for my hobbies as well as this project!
        <br>
        I hope you could get a good sense of who I am and some of my interests!

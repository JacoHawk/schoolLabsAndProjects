        Bailey is our 13 year old <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cardigan-welsh-corgi/" target="_blank">Cardigan Welsh Corgi</a>.
        We got her when she was just a few months old, back in 2008.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        She loves belly rubs and napping wherever her heart desires.
        Our other dog, Toby, always gets on her nerves, but she knows how to put him in his place!
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        Bailey doesn't like fireworks, thunder, strangers, small children, or large men.
        She also hates when people fight or yell or kiss. She's very sensitive, but very loving.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
        Toby is a 2 year old <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/poodle-toy/" target="_blank">Toy Poodle</a>.
        We got him back in 2019 from a family member who was looking to rehome him.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        He is an energetic little boy that loves to annoy Bailey and my dad with his high pitched yaps.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        Toby also hates strangers, like Bailey, but ends up loving every person he comes to meet.

        </figure>
    </div>
    <p class="desc">
        Winston is our 3 year old short haired cat.
        We adopted him in the spring of 2020 from a shelter in Bloomington and he has slowly become everyone's favorite cuddle buddy.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        He has trouble getting along with Bailey, so he makes sure to steer clear of her and everything usually goes ok.
        Other than that, he loves laying on bellies and waking everyone up at 5 AM with his meows.

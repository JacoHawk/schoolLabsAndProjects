        To begin, let me explain what speedrunning is.

        <p class="column">
            According to <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/knowledgebase/about" target="_blank">Speedrun.com</a> (the official website for speedrunning leaderboards and information), speedrunning can be defined as "<span class="quote">the act of playing a video game with the intent of completing it as fast as possible, for the purposes of entertainment and/or competition.</span>"
            <br>In simplest terms, speedrunning is about completing a game or challenge as fast as possible whether in a game or, in some cases, real life using a defined set of rules.
            <br> On this page, I will specifically be talking about Super Mario Odyssey speedrunning and explain what speedrunning is.

            The video above is the current Any% world record speedrun for Mario Odyssey. It's called an "Any%" run because the goal is simply to beat the game as quickly as possible, regardless of how much of the game is actually completed and regardless of the methods used (glitches, tricks, etc. excluding hacks or cheats).

        Explanation of Speedrun Categories 
    </p>

    <div class="columns">
        <p class="column">
            The Any% category is arguably the easiest when it comes to speedrunning. With other categories like 100%, glitchless, or other game-specific categories, it's easy to see why the most commonly played category is Any%.
            <br><br>100% speedruns are terribly difficult, mainly because of the amount of time people must play the game for. The name is pretty self explanatory: to complete a 100% speedrun, you must complete 100% of the game. Side quests, all collectibles, and every single piece of content must be completed and explored. Some games, like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, take 30+ hours of straight gameplay to 100%. Sleeping or taking breaks is an option, but the timer must continue to run no matter what, or the run is disqualified.
            <br><br>Other categories, like glitchless, have game-specific rules that will vary from game-to-game. Their basic premise is the same, but each game has different mechanics and must be treated differently.
            <br><br>For this page, I focus solely on Super Mario Odyssey Any% speedrunning, which requires quick reflexes, a nearly photographic memory, and a slew of "pixel-perfect" tricks.
            <br><br>Below is a table of the top 3 Any% speedruns for Mario Odyssey. I've listed the players name, time, and the date they posted the speedrun. I've also provided links for each of the runs, which shows the full speedruns as well as some more info.

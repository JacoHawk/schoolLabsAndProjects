            SmallAnt (Tanner Ant) is a full time Twitch streamer and YouTube content creator. He plays games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Minecraft, Super Mario 64, and more.
            <br><br>SmallAnt is one of my favorite content creators because of his energy and the skill that he shows in the games that he plays. I'm always amazed at what he can do in every game he tries out.
            <br><br>SmallAnt also does real life speedruns, such as the "Drillless, 10 Pencils" speedrun he did in September 2020. He sharpenned 10 pencils using a manual pencil sharpenner in 2 minutes and 21 seconds. He still holds 1st place in this category.

            PointCrow (Eric Morino) is also a Twitch streamer and YouTube content creator. He doesn't speedrun many games, and plays more casually than SmallAnt. His only speedruns are in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and a game called Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch.
            <br><br>PointCrow is also part of a speedrunning team called NRG Speedrunning. There are a few other people on the team that I really enjoy watching. Their names are LilKirbs and Kosmic.
            <br><br>PointCrow has very high energy on his streams whether he's speedrunning or casually playing a game. Recently, he speedran the calculator app on the Nintendo Switch. The basic premise of the run is to add 1 over and over until 1,000 is computed. He actaully broke his hand doing this speedrun. While that is just about the most insane thing someone can do to break their hand, I can respect his drive to do the best he can on any game he plays.

        This is a video from NRG Speedrunning on Youtube. The members of NRG play Mario Maker 2 on the Nintendo Switch and try to make the hardest level that they can for LilKirbs to play.
        <br>NRG Speedrunning is one of my favorite channels on YouTube as they make entertaining content and the members of the team are some of the best speedrunners in their respective games.

        <dt>Question 1:</dt>
        <dd>Tell me how to set the position of a background image on my web page using css and give me a couple of different sites that explain it.</dd>

        <dt>Answer:</dt>
        <dd>Using the background-position property, you can position a background image using one or two directions (e.g. left top, right bottom, center left, etc.). If no second direction is specified, it will default the second position to center. The values can also be percentages or specific lengths using (x, y) for the positions unless specified.

        <dt>Rational:</dt>
        <dd>Both W3Schools and MDN Web Docs are very reputable sites for HTML and CSS information. MDN is run by Mozilla and has information for HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, and more. W3Schools covers even more coding languages than MDN and provides information for every single CSS and HTML element.</dd>

        <dt>Question 2:</dt>
        <dd>What was the average wheat yield per acre (in bushels) in the 1800's? What is it now?</dd>

        <dt>Answer:</dt>
        <dd>I found from people.vcu.edu that from 1880-1884, the average wheat yield per acre was 13.3 bushels. I also found that the national average wheat yield per acre was 50 bushels in 2020.</dd>

        <dt>Rational:</dt>
        <dd>People.vcu.edu seems reputable because their sources are cited and the site looks like it is used for educational purposes and made by a professor. PennState Extension seems reputable because they list sources and are a reputable educational site.</dd>

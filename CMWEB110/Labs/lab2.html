<h2> For my second lab, I'd like to tell you a bit about myself! </h2>
</h3>
<p><b>Here's some facts about me:</b></p>
<ol>
<li> I have two dogs (Bailey and Toby) and one cat (Winston). </li>
<li> I love playing video games, especially Rocket League and Valorant. </li>
<li> My favorite genre of movie is horror, and my favorite movie is Hereditary. </li>
</ol></h3>
<p><b>Some activites I enjoy include:</b></p>
 <ul>
 <li> One of my favorite activities is frisbee golfing! It's a great way to get some sun and relax.</li>
 <li> I don't get to do it very often, but kayaking is another one of my favorite activities. I enjoy slowly rowing along a peaceful river with a few friends while listening to music in 80<sup>o</sup> weather. As long as the H<sub>2</sub>O isn't too cold, I'll always take a swim as well!</li>
 <li> My absolute favorite activity is laying with my cat for hours. It's not only my favorite activity, but also the one I spend the most time doing!</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 <h2> Now that I've talked some about myself, let me tell you about my pets!</h2>
 <p><b> I have two dogs: </b></p>
 <dl>
 <dt> Bailey - </dt>
 <dd> She is a <b>13 year old</b> Cardigan Welsh corgi who loves to cuddle but hates hugs and kisses! She is the sweetest dog once she gets to know you, but until then, strangers are public enemy #1.</dd>
 <dt> Toby - </dt>
 <dd> He is a <b>2 year old</b> toy poodle who loves to play and annoy Bailey. He yips and barks all the time so it's hard to like him, but he's still the cutest little boy.</dd>
 </dl>
 <p><b> I also have one cat, and hope to get another soon: </b></p>
 <dl>
 <dt> Winston (Winnie) - </dt>
 <dd> He is a <b>3 year old</b> short haired cat that loves to sleep all day every day. He's the sweetest boy and loves treats! He is constantly being harrassed by our dogs, so it's hard for him to catch a break.</dd>

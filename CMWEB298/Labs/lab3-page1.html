            <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
            <p>
              HTML5 is the newest version of HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, and it has brought some great new features to the web. The previous
              versions of HTML were lacking in a few ways, which is why a lot of sites required proprietary technologies like Adobe Flash. The main
              goal of HTML5 was to get rid of those technologies, and it did! Web applications can now work offline, browsers natively support HD
              video and animations, sites know where you are geographically, and more.<br><br> I've included 2 resources in the navigation bar on the left to learn more about HTML5.

            <h2>HTML5 Semantics</h2>
            <p>
              Another issue with old HTML versions was that it wasn't very accessible. Assistive technologies had trouble discerning the purpose of certain elements.
              HTML5 sought to fix that by using new semantic elements to improve accessibility and the overall organization of code. &lt;section&gt;,
              &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and many more elements were added to separate style from content. These tags benefit all
              sorts of assistive technologies, especially screen readers.

            <h2>How HTML5 Semantics are used</h2>
            <p>
              On this page, there are a few HTML5 elements in use. For starters, I put the title up top inside of a &lt;header&gt; element to show
              that it contains introductory content (the title). The navigation section on the left has been placed in a &lt;nav&gt; element to show
              that it contains navigation links. This main group of paragraphs has been placed in a &lt;main&gt; element because it is the main
              content of the page. Each individual paragraph is also placed in an &lt;article&gt; tag since I want each one to be its own distinct
              paragraph. Lastly, I placed the footer inside of a &lt;footer&gt; tag.

            Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It allows CSS styles to be applied conditionally depending on certain parameters. These
            parameters include media types, such as screen or print, and can target different characteristics of the user's device. The include
            orientation of the device, the screen width or height, whether the device supports hovering, and many more. With media queries, developers
            can make very complex CSS rules that make sure the viewing experience is the same for every possible device.

        <div class="name n2">How to use Media Queries in CSS</div>
        <div class="body p2">
          <p class="body-p">
            Media queries can be applied a few different ways. One way is to put a media query in the head of an HTML page. By doing this, we can link
            certain stylesheets depending on what size the screen is. By using something like
            <span class="code">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="small.css" media="(max-width: 600px)"&gt;</span>, small screens under 600 pixels wide
            will get the "small.css" file applied.<br />
            For example, for devices over 1024 pixels wide, the picture will be the CSS3 logo. It will change to the HTML5 logo for devices under 1024
            pixels wide.<br />
            This is a prime example of how media queries can really spruce up a webpage, but it is only a small trick in a sea of possibilities for
            media queries.

        <div class="body p4">
          <p class="body-p">
            Another thing media queries are great for is printing. When web pages are printed, some aspects of the web page need to be changed. This
            is because web pages tend to have a lot of color and some elements are not visible on physical paper.<br />When there is a link on a
            webpage, users can only see that link when they click it to go visit the linked page. This is an issue for printed webpages. To fix it, we
            can use a media query for printed pages and change up the style for the printed result.<br />
            We can use <span class="code">@media print</span> in our CSS sheet to target HTML content when the page is being printed. As an example, the hyperlink will include the full URL inside of parenthesis when printed:
            <a class="no-print" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a
            >

            CSS Grid is a grid layout system for CSS that relies on a series of columns and rows. It replaces the old trick of using tables as layouts
            for a much more dynamic and accessible layout system. The grid columns and rows can be set to different heights and widths depending on
            the screen size. This allows developers to create robust and flexible layouts for any type of content.<br /><br /><a

            grid animations.

            CSS grid is fairly easy to use with just a few steps to get a simple grid laid out. First, we start with a container. This will be the
            parent div where the grid will reside. Next, we place the children (or the grid contents) inside of the container. <br /><br />That's it
            for the HTML! Now we head over to the CSS where things get a bit more complex. The container should be set to
            <span class="code">display: grid</span> to display the children in a grid layout. We can then change up the columns and rows using
            <span class="code">grid-template-columns</span> or <span class="code">grid-template-rows</span>. All we have to do is simply put widths or
            heights of the templates using whatever unit we'd like. For example, if we want 5 columns and 2 rows, we can do
            <span class="code">grid-template-columns: 50px 30px 40px 10px 40px</span> and
            <span class="code">grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 20px)</span>. For the columns, we're individually defining each column's width. For the
            rows, we're utilizing a function <span class="code">repeat()</span> which allows us to say we want 2 rows of the same height of 20px.<br /><br />
            For the children inside of the container, we can set their positions to specific plots on the grid using grid-area. Grid-area can set the
            grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end properties all in one property.
            <span class="code">grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 3</span> is how it would look if we want an element to start at the first row and end at the
            third row and also start at the second column and end at the third column.<br /><br /><a

            has page full of examples and information on how to make a grid container and how to set the positions of elements.<br />That's pretty
            much it for the basics! You can then add some media queries and change the layout based on screen size to make responsive pages.

                &emsp; &emsp; Brandon Tyrone Marshall is a former NFL wide receiver and current American sports personality who played 13 seasons in the NFL. He played college football at UCF, and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Marshall has also played for the Miami Dolphins, Chicago Bears, New York Jets, New York Giants, and the Seattle Seahawks. After his retirement from the NFL, Marshall became a TV personality, and is a former co-host on FS1's morning show First Things First. Marshall is currently a co-host on Showtime's Inside the NFL and has been on the show for seven seasons.<br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp; Marshall is known for his ability to break and dodge tackles. He led all NFL wide receivers in yards after first contact for the 2007 NFL season. Despite Marshall's long productive career, he has never played in a playoff game. His 12,351 career receiving yards are the most ever by a receiver who has never played in the postseason. On December 13, 2009, against the Indianapolis Colts, Marshall set an NFL record for receptions in a game with 21. He also is one of six players in NFL history to catch at least 100 passes in three consecutive seasons.

                &emsp; &emsp; Robert Paul Gould III played with the Chicago Bears from 2005 to 2015, during which he became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Gould was originally signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2005. He played college football at Penn State.<br><br>
                &emsp; &emsp; Gould enrolled in Penn State University, where he played for the Penn State Nittany Lions football team. Although originally interested in professional soccer, he eventually chose football and asked his high school principal to send a letter of recommendation to Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, who invited him to try out as a freshman walk-on. In four years with the Nittany Lions, he converted 115-of-121 extra point attempts and 39-of-61 field goal attempts.

        <h3>
            Here are a few links to resources that helped me learn CSS:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu-q2zYwEYs" target="_blank">HTML and CSS Crash Course</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: medium; color:#c5e7c5;">W3Schools and MDN Web Docs are incredibly helpful resources for all things programming. Whether you need help with front-end or back-end coding, they both have tons of info and tutorials!<br> YouTube is also an excellent resource for beginner coders. There are tons of videos and series teaching certain languages or helpful tips and tricks!</p>
        <p style="font-size: medium; color:#c5e7c5;">The three different CSS attachment methods are inline, embedded, and external.<br>
        Inline CSS is placed within the opening tag of an element using style="". It's best to use inline css to ensure all the content of the page is still easy to understand without an external CSS document.<br>
        Embedded CSS is placed within the header of the HTML document between a "style" tag. Embedded CSS has similar use cases ass inline, but neither should be used very often. When there is a large amount of CSS to be added to a page, it's alwasy best to use an external CSS document.<br> 
        External CSS doucments are linked in the header and should be used for sites that have a lot of styling. While the other methods are easier, when creating large pages, they can be a real headache to use. External CSS documents allow for the use of ID's and classes which makes the design process much faster as it is easier and quicker to change styles around.</p>

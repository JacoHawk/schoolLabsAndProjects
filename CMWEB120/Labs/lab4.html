            <h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
            <h3>Responsiveness is a very important aspect of web design today. Before tablets and smartphones and smartwatches were a thing, the only devices that could visit web pages were computers, and most of those computers were desktops. Now there are a plethora of different devices that can access web pages. With that being said, web designers have to make sure that each device can use and read every website with ease. Responsive web design ensures that no matter what device a user is using to view a site, the site will be readable and attractive.</h3>
